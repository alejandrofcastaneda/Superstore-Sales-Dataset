This project consisted of downloading an Excel file of retail sales data to analyze it through MS Access. I was able to determine:

•	The average sales amount in the technology sector was the highest, compared to furniture and office supplies,

•	The average sales amount in the consumer segment was the lowest, compared to home office and corporate,

•	September was the month with the highest count of first-class orders in 2018,

•	 The 3 top customers that have made orders most often in 2016 were Peter Fuller, Sung Pak and Matt Abelman,

•	The office supply products that have been sold the most were in the binders sub-category,

•	The total sales amount in the West region was highest, while South was the lowest,

•	The state with highest sales amount was California (with $446,306.46).
