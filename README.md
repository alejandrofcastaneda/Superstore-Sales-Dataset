This project consisted of downloading an Excel file of retail sales data to analyze it through MS Access. I created queries to determine:

•	The average sales amount made by customer segmentation, 

•	First class orders made in 2018,

•	The number of times a customer has ordered products in 2016,

•	The number of times an office supply product has been sold,

•	The total sum of sales made by region,

•	The total sum of sales made by state.
